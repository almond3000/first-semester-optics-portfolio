* Niagara College — First Year (2024–2025)

This repository contains a collection of hands-on optical engineering labs completed as part of my first-year Optical Engineering program at Niagara College.
These projects focus on fundamental optical systems including interferometry, refraction, beam expansion, and lens characterization.
The goal of this repo is to demonstrate my early technical experience with optical alignment, laser setups, and photonics lab equipment.
